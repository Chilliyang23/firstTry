git init

when file created in git, it is by default in 'working directory'.
then, it can be added to staged area for temporary checking.
once everything is settled, it can be committed from staged area to repository

git status 
    - red indicates that the file is in 'working directory'
    - green indicates that the file is in 'staged' area

'git add <file>' is the way of adding file to 'staged' area
'git add .', add everything in 'working directory' to 'staged' area

'git commit -m 'add 1.txt', add file to 'repository'
    '-m' here means message, the text following '-m' can be any messages
    and here 'add 1.txt' is used for explaining the reason of this commit

'git log' - display commit history
        short version, 'git log --oneline

'git checkout -- <file>', delete modified files in 'Changes' in SOURCE CONTROL

'git reset HEAD <file>', put file back from staged area to working directory

'git reset --hard HEAD~1', call back files from repository

'git branch', display all branches available, asterisk is marked on current branch

'git checkout -b feature_a', '-b' is to create a new branch, 'checkout' is to change to another branch.
hence, this command means that firstly create a 'feature_a' and then change to this new branch from current branch
this 'feature_a' branch is created based on 'main' branch, so they are the same at first.

'git checkout <branch name>', change to another branch

'git merge <branch name>', specify the other branch to be merged

'rm -rf .git', delete git repository
